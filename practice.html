      <p class="editable uppercase margin-heading">Sam Whitehead</p>

      <div class="editable">
        <p>
          Born in Northern England in 1995, Sam Whitehead was raised amidst the
          enduring influence of the built environment. His working class
          perspective of architecture embodied a profound connection between
          individuals and the spaces they inhabit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam’s passion for architecture encompasses the idea of designing
          places in which people’s lives and stories take place. Perhaps
          influenced by a childhood surrounded by theatre and a family of
          actors, he is inspired by a building’s ability to become the stage for
          human interaction and connection. Architects have a crucial role to
          design our city as a theatre of experience, and Sam adeptly applies
          this principle to champion positive social change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam studied architecture at the University of Nottingham and a Masters
          at the University of Westminster. His experience both privately and
          with world renowned practices such as Foster + Partners, Grimshaw, and
          Marek Wojciechowski Architects, demonstrates his ability and passion.
          Sam prides himself on designing well-detailed buildings within the
          budget and programme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam found that studying architecture soon became a lifestyle; an
          ongoing development in approaches and outlooks which, in turn,
          developed a strong sense of self. Sam constantly strives to compliment
          design with experience, and continues to travel; providing great
          insight into the parallel notions of place, culture and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breaking away from the corporate nine-to-nine grind of a disoriented
          industry, Sam combined his passion for travel with an unwavering drive
          to explore cultural identity in architecture. After traveling the
          world and experiencing diverse architectural styles and cultural
          influences, he found his true calling in Bali, where he felt an
          undeniable connection to the island's rich heritage and natural
          beauty, prompting him to establish his studio and weave his global
          experiences into locally inspired designs.
